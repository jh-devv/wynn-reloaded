## Features

- ## ‚òÄ Wynntils

  Artemis, the new generation of [Wynntils](https://modrinth.com/mod/wynntils), is the main powerhouse of new features: A mod tailored specifically for Wynncraft that makes the game feel like a proper MMORPG game. From adding custom overlays (e.g. mini-map or improved HP & MP bars), adding keybinds (e.g. casting spells, mounting your horse, or custom actions), to custom sounds and visual features.
  
- ## ‚òÅ Optimizations

  While [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) probably is the best known one, this pack includes several mods to improve overall performance and stability. With compatibility in mind, enjoy increased FPS without losing graphical fidelity!
  
- ## ‚òÇ Graphic Enhancements

  Behold the beautiful Wynncraft landscape with enhanced graphics! Add beautiful shaders with [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris), improve ambience with [Falling Leaves](https://modrinth.com/mod/fallingleaves), and enjoy epic item previews with [Legendary Tooltips](https://modrinth.com/mod/legendary-tooltips)! Wynn Reloaded includes the visually stunning (yet greatly optimized) [Complementary Reimagined](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) and [Complementary Shaders Unbound](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-shaders-v4). The modpack also includes additional mods, such as *Euphoria Patches*, that make the game look **even** better, adding more features to the Complementary Shaders!
